**Lightweight, highly configurable and easy to use data driven form renderer for React**

**Note the project is still experimental and under active development. many more new features will be added in! ðŸŒˆ**

The goal of the component is to fulfil the following requirements
- Able to use the component to generate form by a template
- Able to use each field component with validation feature without a template
- Able to replace built-in component with a custum component easily

## Features
  - Generate form fields using simple template data
  - Built-in field validation
    - Default regexp patterns form text and textarea
    - Support custom pattern validation
    - Built in validation rules for other field types like checkbox, radio and select
  - Conditionally disable fields based on reference fields validity. ( Fields can listen each other ðŸ‘€ )
  - Support separate template data for customizing layout for the form section 
    - Not only customizing each field component
    - Also have a control over styling layout the structure!
  - Get notified for form's validity, pristine, is-dirty ,invalidation text and collated form values via event
